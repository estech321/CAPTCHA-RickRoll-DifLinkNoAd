# CAPTCHA Rick Roll
This is a simple website that pretends to be a Cloudflare Turnstyle (similar to a reCAPTCHA) and ask you to verify you are human. Once the verify button is clicked, it redirects you to the Rick Roll.

## Why?
Many messaging applications, such as Gmail, iMessage, and more give previews of links. If you texted your friend a direct link to the rick roll, or even a shortened URL, it would show them a preview thumbnail and the surprise would be ruined. This page requires the user to manually click a button that sends them to the rickroll.

## How to Use
Just send your friend this link:
[https://estech321.github.io/CAPTCHA-RickRoll/](https://estech321.github.io/CAPTCHA-RickRoll/)
Or, to be less suspicious, use this shortened URL:
[http://tinyurl.com/ywsxwu23](http://tinyurl.com/ywsxwu23)
